	// OOP
	// Object oriented programming is just a way of writing code and classes and
	// objects
	// are basic parts of this method

	/*
	 * 1) because OOP simplifies the development of programs 2) it makes it easy to
	 * manage and maintain large programs 3) OOP is built around objects classes and
	 * many other things which can help us translate real life objects into
	 * computers

// how to write programs using OOP.

	// 1) create classes inside the classes define properties/fields/attributes to
	// translate how an object
	// from real life looks like.

	// 2)create methods/behaviours/functions to define hoe that thing works in real
	// life

//note: 
	// OOP is also supported in many other programming languages like c#, PHP,
	// Python, Javascript etc

	// other than OOP we also have different paradigm or ways of writing code
	// functional programming is one of them.

	// we also have procedural programming.
	
//how do we create a class and its object:
	
	//FIELDS/ATTRIBUTES:
	//class Human{
	//String name;
	//int age;
	//double weight;
	//char gender;
	//}

	//METHODS/FINCTIONS/BEHAVIOURS:
	//void walk(){
	//}
	

//public static void main(String[] args) {

//Human.sameer=new Human();
//sameer.name="Naughty sameer";
//sameer.age=20;
//sameer.weight=90;
//sameer.gender='M';
//sameer.walk();
//}
	//}
	
//in java its convention to call the attributes as fields and call the behaviours as methods
//Rules:
	//1)we can define the fields and methods anywhere in the class.
	
	//2)the sequence of execution only matters when we are inside a method.
